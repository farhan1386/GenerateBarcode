In this tutorial, we will learn how to generate a barcode using ASP.Net by simply entering Text, numbers, and a combination of both in the textbox and click on generate button. I found a very useful library for generating barcodes which is IronBarcode.

You can install it through the NuGet package. It supports .Net Core, Standard & Framework. It has cross-platform support.

To use this library we will create a demo project in a Visual Studio. I am creating ASP.Net Web Application using Web Form for that I am going to use the Visual Studio 2017 version

# How to Install the Barcode Library through NuGet Package Manager

In Visual Studio Select Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for the solution.

Search for the specific package IronBarcode using the search box on the upper left. Select a package from the list to display its information, enabling the Install button and a version-selection drop-down. As shown below screenshot. The NuGet package will be installed for your project and reference will be added.
